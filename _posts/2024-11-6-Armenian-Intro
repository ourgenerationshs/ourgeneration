In September 2023, following a blockade-induced famine and a violent military assault by Azerbaijan, over 100,000 Armenians fled Nagorno-Karabakh. This marked the loss of centuries-old Armenian communities, leaving behind schools, churches, and cultural landmarks. This offensive committed against Artsakh violated the ceasefire agreement established after the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War in 2020. The offensive aimed to disarm and surrender Artsakh, resulting in a surrender agreement mediated by Russian peacekeepers and the subsequent dissolution of all state institutions in Artsakh by January 1, 2024, effectively ending the breakaway state's existence.
  
In terms of both the immediate human suffering and the erasure of cultural heritage, the exodus left devastating impacts. Generations of Armenians had built their lives in Nagorno-Karabakh, cultivating their traditions, institutions, and identity. However, the sudden and violent displacement shattered these communities, forcing families to abandon their homes, livelihoods, and ancestral ties. 
  
In particular, the destruction of Armenian heritage sites was extremely alarming. The deliberate targeting of cultural landmarks, including churches, monuments, and cemeteries, represents not only a violation of international law but also a form of cultural genocide. These sites were not just architectural treasures; they were symbols of Armenian identity, history, and resilience. The obliteration of such monuments not only erases tangible connections to the past but also seeks to erase the very existence of Armenian culture in Nagorno-Karabakh. This revisionist narrative not only distorts the truth, but perpetuates the cycle of violence and intolerance that has plagued the region for decades.
  
Ultimately, the tragedy that unfolded in Nagorno-Karabakh serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need for greater international cooperation and solidarity in the face of violence, injustice, and cultural erasure. Only through concerted efforts to uphold human rights and protect cultural diversity can we hope to prevent such atrocities from happening again in the future.
