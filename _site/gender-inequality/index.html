    "body": "2024/01/04 - According to statistical evidence gathered by Sandy Hook Promise, around 12 children die from gun violence everyday in America and 93% of school shooting cases were planned in advance. Moreover, around 20% of the firearm owners who have children confess that they have unlocked firearms at home(Azrael). These shocking data remind the public of the necessity to understand that the gun violence problem happens everyday in both higher or lower schools, threatening students’ lives. Gun violence problems plague college campuses. One of the most deadly mass shooting cases in schools happened on April 16, 2007 in Virginia tech university. Seung-Hui Cho, a former student of Virginia Tech, killed 33 people on campus, including himself. Cho lived in South Korea when he was younger, and then moved to the United States with his family. He perceived the world differently than other people. According to Cho’s parents and psychiatrist, he was diagnosed with selective mutism and possible autism at a young age. He was extremely quiet in classes and did not establish any close bonds with any of his classmates or teachers. Once his teacher noticed Cho’s abnormal behaviors from the idolization of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who committed the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, and to his school projects expressing his intentions to “repeat Columbine”. However, because of the negelection from the schools and the doctors later in his life, the catastrophic prediction became the truth. In Cho’s case, he was found to have mental issues at the beginning, yet what worsens the situation is the nonfeasance of those people around him. The 32 innocent lives might have been saved if any of Cho’s classmates, teachers, or psychiatrist realized the urgency of his situation and provided him support, or they recognized his behaviors as a threat to public safety and reported it to schools or police. Therefore, we all have the responsibility to pay attention to our surroundings and recognize others’ abnormal behaviors. Besides college shooting cases, lower schools are also threatened by gun violence. On March 28, 2023, the Tennessee police department reported a mass shooting at a Christian school in Nashville. Contrary to what the public suspects, this mass shooting case took place in an elementary school instead of a college campus where school mass shootings normally happen. The shooter, Audrey Hale, a 28 years old alumna from the school, shot and killed three 9 year olds and three adults on the school campus. Later her parents admitted that Audrey legally purchased seven guns, and three of them were used on the day of the incident. Similar to Seung-Hui Cho in the previous case, Audrey Hale also appeared to have psychological issues and proposed her own versions of “Blueprint on destruction”, her journals that are not yet released due to the potential danger it could present to the public, on school shootings. Comparing specifically Cho and Audrey’s gun violence cases, similarities arose from both cases. We can easily see that in both cases, the shooter, who were both former students of their target schools, both experienced some kind of psychological issues and have revealed their intention of performing a mass shooting a long time before the incident. Summarizing all former school shooting cases, the United States government published a booklet on “Protecting America’s Schools, A U. S Secret Service Analysis of Targeted School Violence” for future references. According to the booklet, a majority of attackers showed signs of psychological, behavioral, or developmental issues and approximately 50% had an interest in violent topics. Moreover, most shooters were stressed by relationships with peers or significant others, and almost all had experienced bullying by other students. Gun violences is preventable, as long as we pay attention to the signs it’s showing us. (PSA) In conclusion, in order to have self protection in front of gun violence, students should be able to identify potential gun violence around them through paying more attention to the surrounding and understanding perceptions of the shooters. However, for the purpose of preventing these gun violence cases from happening, institutes should take their responsibilities to protect the students and provide them with a safe and secure learning environment. Improvements such as setting up and training the teachers and the students with code red drills, installing bullet proof doors and windows if possible, and implementing a stricter security check in schools could significantly lower the risks of school shootings.

    "title": "At the Intersection of Film and Our Prison System",
    "body": "2024/01/03 - 500 percent. That’s the growth of our prison population since 1970, says American Civil Liberties Union; it also listed fractions - one in three, one in six, and one in seventeen - separately corresponding to the odds of black, latino, and white boys and their odds of any type of imprisonment in their lifetime. Obviously, our prisons aren’t just growing indiscriminately. So what does that mean for a society obsessed with crime and (unequal) punishment? This article sought to link popular culture with basic data to help inform a general knowledge of the cause and effects of Modern Mass Incarceration. Our first stop was in the beginning of the 70s, where president Nixon led the United States on a series of policies to combat illegal drug production, distribution and consumption which he later coined the “War on Drugs”. The policy is now worldwide, but for the United States, this meant longer sentences and stricter sentencing standards. You might know Scarface, the movie that tells of ambition turned vice, following the story of Tony Montana, a Cuban immigrant turned drug lord. This story is very much set in its milieu of the 1980s, now 10 years from the beginning of the on-going war on drugs. The movie itself not only offered perspective into the minds twisted by the excess of ambition and materialism, but also sets an accurate (in spirit) depiction of the crime scene involving drug importation. With billions invested into the construction of new prisons and an unprecedented rising number of convicts coupled with inadequate funding for reintegrating ex-criminals into society, any period of life behind bars can feel like a life-sentence. Truly, the emphasis on punishment over correction in our prison systems is the biggest tragedy, one that left many people behind, with no real prospect of catching up. Our cultural notion of prison escape then, is understandably pessimistic and necessarily harsh. Compared to Escape from Alcatraz, a 1979 prison escape film which became the 15th highest grossing film of that year, the 1994 film Shawshank Redemption is a box office flop, with negative initial critical response. The film release coincides with the height of “tough on crime” rhetoric, of which none other than our president Joe Biden is a part of. But subsequent generations have taken Shawshank to the highest prestige due to its moving story and its criticism of the social condition - the institutionalization of criminals, the notion that criminals, either due to long sentences or trauma, became better acclimated to the prison rule of power and it’s hierarchies than those of free society. Abuses in criminal labor are also prevalent in this film, which mirrors reality also, where criminals are put to work for no pay. Sounds familiar? Hence some critics of the prison system linking prison labor to slavery. The Shawshank Redemption serves as an example of how films can reflect a truth despite its fictionality. But most importantly, after 50 years of expanding prisons, I think it’s time to invest also in the rehabilitation and reintegration of criminals. Once you get behind, you stay behind.

    "body": "2024/01/03 - Per Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, self-preservation lies near the bottom; demonstrating that humans yearn for safety above just about all else – especially through firearms. In 2022, 45% of households in the United States owned at least one gun; this number was last reached in 2012 after the 2011 Tucson Shooting. Due to wars and exposure to violence, many think safety means having the power to fight back. This belief causes a spike in gun sales after every shooting, and, consequently, a rise in the stocks of companies dealing in firearms. 2021 ended with an astounding 692 – the United States had suffered only 358 five years before. After noting the considerable increase of gun sales, the University of California Davis studied the sales numbers throughout the year. Researchers found that more people were buying firearms both within 30 days of a mass shooting and in December. Naturally, after a mass shooting, people get scared and think that owning a gun will protect them in case of future incidents and level the playing field. As for the trend in December, there exists two main explanations. Firstly, some may buy guns as gifts. However, the more major contributor would be the legislative gun laws that go in effect every year on January 1. Every mass shooting motivates the government to create more laws, and, in doing so, people invest in firearms at the end of year in case of bans. All of these reasons accumulate, and, as of 2020, the state of California measured 1. 16 million gun sales for the year – and the number continues to rise. Additionally, people do not just want guns anymore. Requests for bump stocks – a piece that enhances firing speed – rose ever since a shooting in Las Vegas. The dramatic increase in gun sales after every mass shooting means not only an increase of firearms in circulation, but also higher stocks for those selling these items. Openly-traded firearm companies gain incredible amounts of money after every mass shooting. Both bigger ones, like Sturm, Ruger, &amp; Co. (commonly known as Ruger), and smaller ones, like Smith &amp; Wesson, all follow the same trend. Within one day of a shooting, they will peak and trade at a few dollars higher. Then, they will hover at a dollar or so less than the peak. Firearms company stocks have grown exponentially over the past few years, and citizens can only expect more growth as shootings continue. Firearm companies have gained exorbitant amounts of money as people buy more guns post-shootings. With the growing and constant fear of a shooter, whether that be at school or the park, citizens feel the need to protect themselves. The growing distrust in the police force only adds to this. People feel the need to turn to the cause of their worries in order to live their life with some feeling of comfort and security. Should mass shootings die down, this might mean a disastrous fate for firearm companies.  Sources: Luscombe, Belinda. “Mass Shootings Are a Crisis.

    "title": "The Shot on Mental Health",
    "body": "2024/01/02 - In the United States, the incidence of gun violence has increased to 43,000 deaths every year, an increase of more than 10,000 deaths as compared to a decade ago. This increase causes a pervasive feeling of insecurity and hypervigilance in people, leading to mental health challenges. Examples of improper gun use include mass shootings, gang violence, and police shootings, which all take a toll on the mental health of victims and witnesses. The trauma, fear, and grief associated with gun violence can lead to a range of mental health issues, such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and substance abuse. In particular, those illnesses cause people to remain vulnerable to trauma for years and damage their nervous systems. The impact of gun violence on the nervous system can be severe and long-lasting. The sudden and traumatic nature of gun violence can trigger the release of stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline, which can cause significant changes in the brain and nervous system. These changes result in a range of physical and psychological symptoms, including increased heart rate, rapid breathing, hypervigilance, and other symptoms of PTSD. According to CWLA, children who experience gun violence are exposed to negative psychological effects, “including anger, withdrawal, post traumatic stress, and desensitization to violence” (Garbarino et al. , 2002). Exposure to gun violence leads to changes in the structure and function of the brain, particularly in areas responsible for emotional regulation and cognitive processing. Therefore, victims are subject to mood swings and health issues such as depression and anxiety. In addition, gun violence disproportionately affects certain groups of people, including minorities and low income individuals. For people with lower socioeconomic status, they often live in areas where gun violence occurs more commonly, thus being exposed to more fatal and nonfatal shootings. Furthermore, people who live in neighborhoods with high rates of gun violence are more likely to experience chronic stress, causing an increase in allostatic load, damaging the immune system and disrupting the menstrual cycle. Moreover, certain demographic groups, such as children and women, are at a higher risk of gun violence, making them more vulnerable targets of mental disorders. Lastly, not only does gun violence cause mental illnesses in victims, it also stigmatizes the people with mental illnesses and intensifies social tension. In the aftermath of a mass shooting or other violent incident involving firearms, people often blame the perpetrator’s mental illness as the cause of the violence. This blame can lead to stigmatization and discrimination against people with mental illnesses, causing unfair social exclusion and reduced access to healthcare services. For example, the National Rifle Association lays the blame of mass shootings on people with mental illnesses, while in reality such illnesses are not a reliable predictor of violence. Overall, gun violence has a significant impact on mental health, which can lead to long-lasting physical and psychological symptoms. Individuals who are exposed to gun violence are at a higher risk of developing PTSD, anxiety, and depression. Moreover, gun violence disproportionately affects minorities, people with lower socioeconomic status, and those who have mental illnesses. Therefore, it is important to correctly analyze the nature of gun violence and promote social inclusion and acceptance for those with mental illnesses.

    "title": "Comparing Gun Laws in Foreign Countries to the United States",
    "body": "2024/01/02 - Gun laws are a hotly debated topic around the world, with many countries implementing strict regulations on firearms in order to reduce the incidence of gun-related crime. The United States, however, has historically taken a more liberal approach to gun ownership, with many individuals advocating for their right to bear arms. In this article, we will compare and contrast gun laws in other countries with those in the United States. According to the Gun Violence Archive, there were 43,559 incidents of gun violence in the United States in 2021, resulting in 11,347 deaths and 23,129 injuries. In contrast, countries with stricter gun laws such as Canada and Japan have significantly lower rates of gun violence. Canada had 223 gun-related deaths in 2019, while Japan had only six. One of the main differences between gun laws in the United States and other countries is the ease with which individuals can obtain firearms. In the United States, there is no federal law requiring background checks on all gun sales, and in many states, individuals can purchase guns at gun shows without any background checks at all. In contrast, countries such as Canada and Australia require background checks on all gun purchases, and in many cases, individuals must demonstrate a legitimate reason for owning a firearm. Another significant difference is the types of firearms that are legal to own. In the United States, there are few restrictions on the types of guns that individuals can own, with some states allowing the ownership of automatic weapons and high-capacity magazines. In contrast, countries such as Japan and the United Kingdom have strict laws prohibiting the ownership of handguns and assault rifles. There is also a difference in the training required to obtain a gun license. In many countries, such as Canada and Australia, individuals must complete a safety course and demonstrate proficiency in handling firearms before they are allowed to purchase a gun. In the United States, there is no such requirement, and many individuals can purchase firearms without any training at all. Finally, there is a difference in the way gun ownership is viewed in different countries. In the United States, there is a strong cultural attachment to the right to bear arms, with many individuals viewing gun ownership as a fundamental right. In contrast, many countries view gun ownership as a privilege that must be earned and regulated. In conclusion, there are significant differences in gun laws between the United States and other countries. While the United States takes a more liberal approach to gun ownership, with fewer restrictions on the types of guns that individuals can own and less regulation around the purchase and training required to obtain a gun license, countries with stricter gun laws such as Canada and Japan have significantly lower rates of gun violence. It is clear that the issue of gun control is complex and multifaceted, and will continue to be a topic of debate for years to come.

    "title": "Firing Blasters in Cold Blood",
    "body": "2024/01/01 - Since its debut in 1977, Star Wars has captivated audiences around the world with its advanced technology, unique characters, and unforgettable one-liners. But even as Anakin Skywalker wrestles with Count Dooku over two lightsabers and Luke Skywalker fire the torpedo that destroyed a whole planet, the work (or rather bloodshed) inflicted by blasters remains inconspicuous. In the Star Wars universe, blasters are fictional energy-based weapons powered by an energy cell or power pack. When the trigger is pulled, blasters generate and propel superheated plasma or energy particles from a barrel or emitter as bolts of energy that burn a hole through their victims and cauterize their organs. Despite orchestrating the rise of Star Wars, blasters evolved over time to show the complexity of major protagonists murdering in cold blood on their journey for “the greater good”. In the original 1977 release of Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope, wisecracking smuggler Han Solo, portrayed by Harrison Ford, finds himself cornered by Greedo, a Rodian bounty hunter commissioned by crime lord Jabba the Hutt seeking to collect a debt. In the original theatrical release, Han shoots Greedo under the table first, quickly dispatching Greedo and narrowly escaping danger. However, in subsequent re-releases and blue-ray editions of the film, the scene was altered to show Greedo shooting first, with Han narrowly dodging the shot and then firing in self-defense. Inspired by the real-life counterpart Mauser C96, Han Solo’s blaster pistol DL-44 pistol has helped Han escape the shadiest situations. However, this scene has sparked some controversy. On one hand, people wanted to see the ruthless side of Han Solo–a smuggler who only fends for himself which helps pave the way for his redemption. However, others argued for the inner character and morale of Han Solo, with Goerge Lucas eventually commenting that he “never designed Han to be a ruthless killer”. If Han shot first, not only will this lower his reputation among smugglers and possibly the rebel alliance, his low credibility will affect his future bounty runs. Meanwhile, if Greedo shot first, the event can be interpreted as Han’s quick reactions along with the greed of the Hutt Cartel. Regardless, firing any blaster in this context vilifies the perpetrator and brings a menacing connotation to firearms. In season 2 of The Mandalorian, Mayfeld, a former Imperial sharpshooter, is forced to confront his past and face the officer responsible for his unit’s deaths. The officer, seemingly unrepentant, makes condescending remarks about the deaths, triggering Mayfeld’s rage. In a moment of catharsis, Mayfeld shoots the officer, showing that his allegiances lie with his own moral compass rather than with the Empire or even the rebellion. Wielding the Rodian DT-12, Mayfeld demonstrates the significance of a blaster shot and the transformation of themes in Star Wars. Much like Han Solo, Mayfeld is the hero of the segment and sets off a chain of events that eventually leads to the downfall of the empire, glorifying his use of gun violence. Unlike Han Solo, however, Mayfel is meant to be an antihero who serves his morals instead of a greater cause. However, this reckless act also jeopardizes the mission, forcing the Mandalorian to draw weapons and fight off overwhelming imperial forces. Even if an officer is guilty of reckless endangerment, U. S. laws indicate it is usually not in the hand of the victim to determine their survival. The show creates tension by showing the similarities between the imperial officer and Mayfeld, as both shared the same goal of unifying the galaxy yet both used different means to achieve it. The officer’s condescending tone highlights the possibility of Mayfeld’s greed for personal satisfaction for revenge and popularity over the greater good. At the end of the day, Mayfeld’s blaster silences suspicions of his allegiance and draws an ironic similarity between him and the imperials. In the Disney+ TV show Andor, Cassian Andor was threatened by two inebriated off-duty imperial officers. Playing off of their gullibility, Cassian Andor killed an officer by snapping his neck to the ground. With tears streaming down his face, the author begged to join his partner and Andor executed him without hesitation. Wielding the K-16 Bryar Pistol, Andor is a long way off from his patriotic self in Rogue One. A smuggler by trade and a ruthless killer at best, Cassian Andor was just a mercenary making his way to the galaxy in pursuit of imperial credits. Unlike the other protagonists, Cassian Andor did not trust in any cause, believing all of them to be corrupt beyond saving. The show clearly moves away from traditional values of the significance of blasters as Andor’s willingness to kill warped the image of a righteous hero. Despite recognizing the officers under the influence of alcohol, Andor’s disdain for an unbalanced society questions his ethical implications in the first episode of the show, setting up a character arc that redeems Andor from a cruel mercenary to a reactionary rebel. The violence of these three shots is underestimated, especially in the context of such a large franchise. However, Cassian Andor’s survival ultimately led to Rogue One and the survival of the rebel fleet, encouraging Han Solo’s rescue, and later Mayfeld’s assistance to hunt down imperial remnants. If all these events are interconnected and eventually led to 3 major wars in Star Wars, the franchise clearly outlines the lasting impact of gun violence. As the use of a gun led to the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand and the conflict of 2 world wars, gun control becomes increasingly important as the tension between countries today becomes even tighter.

    "body": "2023/03/12 - The Kahramanmaras Earthquakeby Annie Zhu On February 6th, 2023, two devastating earthquakes struck Turkey at its Syrian border. Following the first magnitude 7. 8 earthquake, another magnitude 7. 5 earthquake hit nine hours later. Thousands of people were killed and billions of dollars were lost from physical damage. The state authorities urgently declared a level 4 emergency and called for international assistance while the death toll climbed rapidly. To date, more than 9. 1 million people have been affected, and more than 45,000 people were killed in this incident. By March 1, 2023, more than 11,000 aftershocks in the region have also added to the devastation. This earthquake is one of the largest in Turkey’s history, along with the 1668 North Anatolia earthquake and the 1939 Erzincan earthquake. One thing is certain – the destructive consequences of the event will remain for years to come. The impact of the Kahramanmaras earthquake has had severe negative effects on physical and mental health of the residents in Turkey and Syria. Since the quake on February 6th, 1. 9 million people have relocated and now live in temporary shelters after the disaster destroyed their houses. These poor living conditions make the survivors susceptible to health issues. Physical effects aside, the experience has led people to develop trauma and increased risk for chronic anxiety and depression. For instance, the survivors may develop Survivor’s Guilt as they believe that they have done something wrong when others have passed away in the tragic event. Furthermore, the Kahramanmaras Earthquake directly damaged $34. 2 billion worth of buildings and facilities in Türkiye and Syria. This also exposed the design problems in buildings that were vulnerable to strong earthquakes, leading to more destruction due to anthropogenic factors. Ultimately, the Kahramanmaras Earthquake contributed to a large humanitarian crisis and caused economic problems that are affecting the lives of millions of people. In response to the Kahramanmaras Earthquake, countries around the world have offered humanitarian support to relieve the level of destruction. For example, the United Nations have offered multiple cross-border aid operations to deliver supplies. The Bab Al-Hawa, Bab Al-Salam, and Al-Ra’ee have all been open for UN aid delivery, and by March 4th, 583 trucks with aid have crossed into Northwest Syria to provide assistance. However, according to an IFRC market assessment, hot meals, hygiene items, winter clothes, and many more critical necessities are still desperately needed in the affected areas. Overall, being one of the worst earthquakes in recent years, the Kahramanmaras Earthquake has transformed the lives of many and is continuously affecting more. Similar to many other large-scale earthquakes in history, it destroyed local communities, the economy, and killed thousands of people. In addition to learning the details about how this earthquake has affected Türkiye and Syria and how the United States plays a role in this event, this issue also introduces past earthquakes that have heavily injured communities around the world. By learning about the history of earthquakes and juxtaposing different earthquakes for comparison, we will discuss the multifaceted impact of natural disasters in a comprehensive manner. From the effect on people’s mental health to global climate change, understanding the context beyond the Kahramanmaras Earthquake is essential for teenagers to provide better assistance. Letter from the Editors in ChiefHello, we’re the Editors in Chief of Our Gen! Thank you for reading the March 2023 issue of Our Gen. Our goal for our club is to connect the teenagers in our current digital age to major current issues to help us further understand and care about the world around us. As writers, artists, and editors, our team has delved into current issues, connecting them back to our lives. Understanding earthquakes in Turkey is extremely important, and so is understanding how the natural fundamental environmental issue is affecting the entire world, including our homes. For example, California fault lines provide a dangerous possibility for earthquakes up to a magnitude of eight. In cases such as this, we believe that it is important to educate teenagers about these natural disasters so we can better protect ourselves and perhaps, one day, to be able to protect the human race from those deadly disasters. We want to thank our amazing team for their hard work on this issue, our advisor Mrs. Chung for her constant support, and a special thank you to Ms. Tekin for inspiring us to take action and to influence others regarding the Turkey earthquakes. Our Generation reminds us how closely connected people are, and how even a small positive remark can leave a huge trace in someone’s lives. With this, we hope our readers will take away the importance of understanding our world. Our Generation creates a platform for teenagers to utilize their voices and actions. Even more so, we would like to encourage and empower young adults to become agents of change and to make those positive impacts for our society. We, young adults, can shape the future. We are the future. Sincerely,Chanah Y. &amp; Melody Y.

    "title": "History of Earthquakes Around the World",
    "body": "2023/03/09 - Small earthquakes are quite common worldwide; a million or so happen each year. However, certain places are more susceptible to earthquakes due to their location near the seven major tectonic plates. As countries in those areas have continued to develop, new technologies lessen the damage and give citizens earthquake warnings, lowering mortality rates. So although high-magnitude earthquakes remain dangerous, the amount of damage they inflict is dependent on access to technologies to prevent earthquakes and governmental measures taken towards minimizing the dame of earthquakes. This is shown through the comparison of Japan and Haiti. In 2010, Haiti experienced a magnitude 7. 0 earthquake that killed around 222,570 people. According to the Earthquake Magnitude Scale, an earthquake with a magnitude of 7. 0 is considered a major earthquake but is not at the magnitude of other very destructive earthquakes. Still, the Haitian Earthquake had one of the highest death tolls from any earthquake in the 21st century. One of the reasons for this tragedy is the disorganization and lack of standardization in buildings in Haiti. When the 2010 earthquake hit, there was no early warning for its citizens. Also, there is no “national building code” enforced by the government, says Fouche, a Haitian earthquake engineer. The economic state in Haiti also played a role in why this earthquake was so deadly. Most people cannot afford newer technology developed to help lessen the impact of earthquakes, like shock absorption in buildings. In Japan, because of its economic wealth, there are now buildings that have been designed with base isolators that allow a building to move from side to side while remaining standing during an earthquake. The government also has earthquake-resistant standards for new buildings and an early warning system to notify the citizens when there is an earthquake. A combination of effective warning and new technology is why when a 9. 1 earthquake then tsunami happened in Japan, there were 11 times fewer deaths, even though the earthquake in Japan had a much high magnitude. These advancements have caused earthquakes in Japan to have fairly low mortality rates in recent years but have also helped prevent the amount of property damage from earthquakes. Overall, earthquake magnitude, economic wealth, and government stability all contribute to the amount of damage that such a natural disaster will inflict upon a country. As the methods for earthquake damage control develop and become accessible, we hope all countries at risk of earthquakes will eventually be able to protect all of their citizens.

    "body": "2023/03/08 - On February 6th, 2023, Turkey was hit by a powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 6. 9. It struck the eastern province of Van, causing extensive damage to buildings and infrastructure and claiming the lives of at least 45,000 people. The impacts of the earthquake were widespread and impacted many civilians. Many residents were left homeless, without access to necessities such as food or clean water. The earthquake triggered landslides and rockfalls, making rescue efforts difficult and dangerous for first responders. Despite those effects, one of the most devastating impacts of the earthquake was the high death toll. As rescue teams worked to search and uncover survivors from the fallen rubble, the death toll continued to hike up. The number of people affected was even worse than normal, because the earthquake hit in the early hours of the morning, catching many residents off guard and trapping them inside their homes. As a result, many people were unable to escape in time and were buried alive. In addition, the earthquake caused significant damage to infrastructure. Homes, schools, hospitals, and other buildings were destroyed or badly damaged. The earthquake also caused major disruptions to transportation, making it difficult for emergency responders to reach affected areas and for residents to access aid and resources. The earthquake also had a significant economic impact on the region, with many businesses and industries affected by the destruction of infrastructure and the loss of lives. The region is known for its agriculture and livestock industries, both of which were severely impacted by the earthquake. The destruction of homes and buildings also led to a decline in tourism, which is a major source of income for the region. The World Bank’s Disaster Assessment Report estimates that the damage caused by the earthquake will total up to more than $34 billion dollars. The earthquake had a psychological impact on the residents of the affected areas. Many residents were traumatized by the experience and were left feeling vulnerable and uncertain about their future. The loss of loved ones and the destruction of homes and communities left residents struggling to cope with the aftermath of the earthquake. In the aftermath of the earthquake, there have been calls for increased investment in disaster preparedness and management in Turkey and around the world. While it is impossible to predict or prevent natural disasters, taking proactive measures to prepare for them can help to minimize the loss of life and damage to infrastructure. This includes investing in early warning systems, training for emergency responders, and ensuring that critical infrastructure is designed and built to withstand the impacts of natural disasters. The loss and damage of the earthquake will forever serve as a reminder of the importance of disaster preparedness and management in reducing the impact of natural disasters. As we move towards the future, hopefully, the new preparations learned from this experience will improve our response towards future similarly devastating earthquakes and allow us to preserve more lives.

    "body": "2023/03/07 - Earthquakes prove to be one of the most unique and dangerous natural disasters due to their unpredictability and invisibility. While people do not consistently fear them, even the slightest tremor can lead to panic, especially near fault lines. Fault lines, or the boundaries between tectonic plates, mark the areas that are prone to violent earthquakes. California and Turkey have some of the most relevant fault lines, with the former’s infamous San Andreas Fault and the latter’s North Anatolian Fault. Both fault lines, while similar in some aspects, hold their own secrets and dangers. Geologists classify the San Andreas Fault as a slip-strike fault, due to the way the Northern Pacific and North American plates collide. The former collides against the latter in a way that is also classified as a right-lateral fault. The SAF extends over 800 miles – about 14,080 football fields – from the Gulf of California to around San Francisco. While no reliable way of predicting seismic activity exists, researchers have noticed that an earthquake of about magnitude 6. 0 comes every 22 years. The most recent ones have been in 2004 with a magnitude of 6. 0 and 1989 with a magnitude of 6. 9. The latter especially caused significant damage in areas like Monterey; it resulted in about 60 deaths, thousands of casualties, and billions of dollars in damages. It is also worth noting that not only is the earthquake itself extremely dangerous and deadly, but the aftershocks too. These may come moments or even days after the original earthquake and catch people by surprise. The San Andreas Fault produces some of the most deadly earthquakes, not unlike recent seismic activity in Turkey. The North Anatolian Fault falls in the same category as the San Andreas Fault; it too is a slip-strike and right-lateral fault. The collision happens between the Eurasion and Anatolian-Aegean plates. The NAF’s size rivals the SAF’s, as it stretches over the Marmara Sea well into the east of Turkey. The transform’s irregular seismic activity leaves no hint of when the next earthquake can occur. The last earthquakes in 2022 had a magnitude of 6. 1 and the ones in 1999 had a magnitude of 7. 2. The most recent earthquakes significantly extended the fault line westward into the Marmara Sea, which exponentially increases the areas impacted whenever an earthquake occurs. The North Anatolian Fault’s unpredictability and immense size means it has the potential to produce a deadly earthquake at any moment. The San Andreas Fault and North Anatolian Fault are both active fault lines with sizes that surpass most others. With a history of incredibly high magnitude earthquakes, both leave neary-inhabitants cautious and wary of incoming activity. To combat this, California, Turkey, and other countries at risk of high-magnitude earthquakes have been working to boost infrastructure and figure out ways to minimize damage. For example, students undergo earthquake drills in order to be informed of what to do in the case of a disaster. The SAF and NAF are forces to be reckoned with, and their mere presence is enough to leave people with a sense of unease.

    "body": "2023/03/06 - On February 6, 2023, a catastrophic earthquake changed the lives of millions of people in Turkey and Syria. This earthquake resulted in a death toll of more than 50,000 people, while leaving millions more people homeless. This 7. 8 magnitude earthquake will not only lead to years of rebuilding, but also mental health problems for those who survived. Mental health issues are prevalent all around the world. In America, nearly 20% of all adults suffer some form of mental illness with 10 million of them suffering severe mental illness. When someone experiences trauma, they become more vulnerable to developing mental illnesses, making the issue even more prevalentA study on the 2010 Canterbury earthquake in New Zealand found that there was an association between increased rates of disorder and increased rates of exposure to trauma. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety levels, nicotine addiction, and overall disorders all increased for survivors after the earthquake, and they could last for up to seven years after the earthquake. The severity of the illness also results from many factors. For example, people who live in poorer regions of a city are more likely to have trauma because the poorer infrastructure leads to more destruction. This means that there are more people in the area who are suffering and dying, contributing to that trauma. This is especially true in many regions in Turkey and Syria, where they do not have the buildings like Japan that are designed to withstand strong earthquakes as a result of all the time and money spent to ensure their buildings can be used again after an earthquake. Among the victims of the earthquake, children are especially vulnerable to trauma. They can experience long term anxiety, trouble sleeping, and changes in behavior or attitude, which impacts their physical growth and development. Other signs of mental trauma include stomach aches, nightmares, nausea, trouble concentrating and more. While the symptoms may not linger, an incident or conversation that reminds them of the trauma can easily trigger the symptoms again. To better understand the impact of trauma on a person, one must look at how it affects the brain. The brain consists of many regions, three which are significantly impacted by trauma. First, the amygdala, which plays a role in emotions like fear. If it senses an external stress factor in the surroundings, it perceives it as a threat and arouses the emotion of fear. Those with PTSD have increased activity in their amygdala, leading to constant stress and anxiety. Second, the hippocampus is used for storing and retrieving memories in the brain. They can vividly remember these traumatic experiences, causing fear and stress even if they are in a safe environment. Third, the prefrontal cortex is in charge of regulating emotions, and it is forced to work overtime to counteract the negative emotions coming from the amygdala, resulting in those with trauma struggling to control their emotions. Overall, people who were directly affected by the earthquake have an increased risk of developing mental illness. However, those who are reading about the earthquake on mainstream media may also experience feeling overwhelmed or useless. For these cases, the best solution is to step away from the internet, reflect on inner emotions, and research ways to help those affected by the earthquake. While all this may seem depressing, the bright side is that PTSD can lead to growth and development within people. They become more resilient, form new relationships and perspectives along the way, which would accompany them for the rest of their lives.

    "body": "2023/03/05 - “They’re saying that the west is prioritizing politics over the humanitarian situation, but that’s not true. To give priority to one over the other both situations - the humanitarian and the political - have to exist. In the west, only the political situation exists, not the humanitarian. The politicization of the situation - that’s normal; but the humanitarian situation don’t exist, either today or in the past,” Syrian president Bashar Al-Assad said to interviewers. Destroyed buildings can be seen in the background of the clip. - Sky News UK When two consecutive earthquakes struck Turkey and northern Syria, twenty thousand people were buried alive while hundreds of thousands of others were displaced from their homes. Many Syrians still seek asylum from neighboring countries, primarily Turkey, which worsened the already tense debate among EU members on refugee issues. Just before the earthquake hit, leaders of the EU gathered to implement stricter border control that would limit irregular migration. They discussed surveillance, asylum registration, and return measures. However, the advent of the earthquake caused an influx of refugees from Syria and Turkey to EU countries. Mixed with other conflicts such as the Ukrainian war displacing 8 million people, the EU’s migration policies are clearly unenthusiastic and cautious. But the refugee problem is not a new one. In 2011, what began as teens protesting against the brutal reign of the Al-Assad regime in Syria became a full-scale civil war as civilians mobilized in retaliation. The rebels hoped to establish a new rule away from the oppressive Assad family rule. In response, the Syrian army mobilized and struck cities with the most rebel activity. In the early stages, the army laid siege to Dereaa, the first of many sieges that would kill thousands of civilians. The rebel army lacked professional organization, and the Syrian National Coalition eventually emerged as the representative of Syrians. Yet the coalition’s inefficiency, mixed with the government intentionally freeing extremist religious prisoners, gave rise to Al-Qaeda and the Islamic state. These religious extremist groups proved efficient in combat against the government regime, although their motivation was to capitalize on the chaos of the civil war, establish a footing in Syria, and create a new nation under the Sunni doctrine. The Assad regime and its biggest opposition, the Islamic State, both target civilians in the war, killing thousands. The diplomacy of the war was complicated, as many attempted political resolutions of the conflict failed. This created a stalemate as many countries tried to provide military and humanitarian assistance instead. The US, UK, and France have aided the Syrian resistance force in training and medical provision, while Russia and Iran provided the Syrian government with soldiers. But in 2020, Russia closed three of the four routes used for the delivery of humanitarian aid. Early 2020 saw the official ceasefire, though the destruction of the war forced over 13. 5 million Syrians from their homes and 6. 8 million refugees hosted in over 100 countries. The war also crippled the economy. The earthquake of February 2023 showed us the fragility of a nation marred by civil conflict, as the quakes destroyed more buildings in Syria and worsened the pre-existing economic, social, and political issues in Syria. In many ways, the Earthquake in Syria is an extension of the crisis of the civil war. President Assad’s comments are extreme in dismissing completely the presence of humanitarian aid from EU countries, and it also reveals hidden intentions and alliances.

    "body": "2023/03/04 - Threatening to strike at any place and time, an earthquake is a rapid shaking caused by the shifting of rocks underneath the earth’s surface. In order to prepare your home for such a phenomenon, fasten all bookcases and shelving to walls. Place large, heavy, and fragile objects on lower shelves. Know where the electricity, gas, and water switches and valves are so they can be shut off quickly. Once an earthquake starts, it is important that everyone knows how to react. Create, practice, and follow an emergency plan that includes safe places where everyone can take cover, like a sturdy piece of furniture. If it starts while you are inside a car, pull over and stop, making sure to set the parking brake. Turn on the radio for emergency broadcast information as well. If outdoors, stay away from any buildings or tall trees and find an open area. In coastal areas, make sure to find higher ground as a tsunami could pose threats to your home and family. Finally, if inside, avoid running outside and don’t stand under doorways. Drop to the ground, cover your head and neck, and hold onto something sturdy. If a fire starts in one’s home, they may only have two minutes to gather their loved ones and escape. A fire is a natural disaster that can strike unexpectedly, which is why it is important to be prepared. Smoke alarms should be installed in every level of the home. These alarms must be tested once a month, because if they are not, the people of the household will not be alerted in the case of a fire . Additionally, every household must have an emergency escape plan. Even if the alarms work, residents may not survive the fire if they don’t designate a meeting place and don’t have knowledge of the safest way to evacuate. Not only should households be prepared for fires, but they should also take steps to prevent them. For example, smoking indoors was the leading cause of home fire deaths from 2014 to 2018. These statistics should convince smokers to avoid doing so while indoors. Furthermore, cooking with negligence poses a fire hazard. Be attentive,: stay close to the kitchen while food is cooking, and make sure flammable items are 3 feet away from the stovetop. Fatalities can also occur because of human interaction with the environment. Lung cancer, respiratory infections, and heart disease: these are all diseases caused by air pollution. According to the World Health Organization, 2. 4 million people die each year from air pollution. Human activity, especially in highly populated cities, is the major cause of this issue. Citizens should take steps to protect the environment and reverse these detrimental effects. For example, using less energy such as electricity and gasoline will directly help with the global problem of air pollution. Turning off the lights or shutting off the TV are simple habits that prove to be impactful. Some home appliances, like light bulbs and stoves, use more energy than others, so avoid energy-hungry appliances. Solar power is also an excellent way to reduce emissions, as solar panels don’t release greenhouse gasses. Even while on the road, drivers can reduce their carbon footprint by opting for climate-friendly electric cars and leaving. Additionally, children and teens can either take public transportation or carpool on the way to school. Though tragedy threatens to strike at any moment, we can take steps to prevent these deaths.

    "body": "2023/03/03 - This recent cold weather over the West Coast has more disastrous impacts than one may think. Last week, on March 5th, Texas saw snow for the first time in years. California has been hit with a wave of cool weather, causing there to be snow on the Hollywood sign and hail in Newport Beach. This caused a flurry of road closures, as well as many floods and storms. Mudslides, fallen trees, and power outages are only some examples of the environmental destruction that this cold streak weather has caused. For one of the first times in 20 years, Los Angeles’ weather has stayed below 60 degrees for 8 consecutive days. Although this is a delight for skiers, it also indicates the presence of an environmental disaster. Currently, though weather forecasters predict a warming period that will follow the storms, Newport Beach and the Orange County area continue to see downpours, stormy weather, and constant frigid temperature. Despite its regional impact, this cooling period may seem insignificant in the context of global events. Currently, global warming, the heating of the surface of the Earth from pollution, has become a more pressing issue in recent events. Some causes of global warming include greenhouse gas emissions and industrial processes that release air pollutants into the atmosphere. In current news, a company called Willow is causing much controversy. President Biden is in the process of signing a bill that would allow Willow to build three oil drilling sites in Alaska, which will inevitably worsen the pollution that causes global warming. Lawmakers are backing this project with the belief that it will create more employment opportunities, but environmental activists argue that the benefits are not worth the cost of the environment. Additionally, indigenous populations in Alaska worry that this project will infringe on their territory, as many large companies have done in the past. Before global warming occurs, scientists have predicted that the Earth will engage in a global cooling process. Historically, global cooling has occurred before major industrialization projects. In the 1970s, global cooling occurred before mass industrialization started global warming. This leads scientists to the question, was the Earth cooling down before it began to warm? The data from a study conducted by the University of Arizona goes to show that yes, the Earth was cooling. This is significant because if history repeats itself, this could impact our interpretation of the recent small-scale weather anomaly that is occurring on the West Coast. Although the colder than usual weather along the West Coast may not be an immediate cause of alarm, it reminds us that global warming is still a pressing concern.

    "body": "2023/02/28 - As one of the most important sporting events in the world, the FIFA World Cup in Qatar had over 5. 4 billion viewers. Since the announcement of the Qatar World Cup in December 2010, construction and preparation commenced to make the first FIFA World Cup in the Middle East possible. Immigrants from India and Africa built stadiums, secured safety of the games, and provided service, acting as a crucial factor that allowed the World Cup to take place. A total of two million migrant workers helped to facilitate the process, but among them, over 6,500 people have died due to poor living and working conditions, highlighting the underlying problem behind the World Cup and exposing the larger topic of worker abuse. The FIFA World Cup was not the first example of abuse of migrant workers as the root of the problem can be traced back to the last century. A significant factor contributing to workers’ abuse in Qatar is the Kafala System, or the Sponsorship System. Originally adopted in the 1950s, this system legally binds foreign workers to their employers, leaving the workers prone to manipulation and without the ability to escape such abuse. While the system was originally created to enhance regulation between employers and migrant workers, this policy now only takes away migrant workers’ freedom and makes them dependent on their employers. For instance, employers were responsible for renewing migrant workers’ resident permits, which the workers themselves had no control over. However, when the permits failed to be renewed, the workers then became the victims that had to bear the consequences themselves. Furthermore, the employers also had the power to cancel workers’ permits, demonstrating the power disparity which dismisses the laborer’s human rights and causes the workers to be stuck in a cycle of abuse. Furthermore, other prohibitions such as passport confiscation prevent workers from leaving the country, adding onto the problem. The lack of labor unions and labor laws in the society also shows problematic judicial and legislative practices that are hostile to migrant workers. Collectively, the system in Qatar made the migrant workers prone to labor exploitation, leaving them vulnerable during the FIFA World Cup. During the construction of the stadiums, the two largest problems the workers faced were wage delay and injustice. Amnesty International revealed that 100 employees of Qatar Meta Coats were not paid any wages for as long as seven months. In response to this, FIFA stated that they were unaware of this issue, implying that they failed to take cases of human rights abuses linked to the World Cup seriously. Moreover, even when workers were paid wages, the amount they received was extremely minimal. Ironically, while Qatar had spent nearly $220 billion on new infrastructure for the World Cup, they had kept labor costs low for the migrant workers. In addition to low wages, migrant workers in Qatar received lack of proper recognition for their deaths, and the true causes of their deaths were hidden by the responsible committees. In fact, while there have been 37 deaths that were directly linked to construction of World Cup stadiums, 34 of them were classified as “non-work related”. In many other examples, the deaths were covered up as “natural death” in order to conceal the workers’ abuse. Regarding this issue, ongoing protests and public reforms were also important in dictating the prospect of migrant workers’ future. In 2017, the Qatar government signed an agreement with the International Labor Organization (ILO) to prevent labor exploitation and adhere labor practices to the international standards. This marks a sign for positive change, but it will not be effective until it is properly enforced. However, in many cases, weak implementation limits the impact of beneficial legislation to the workers. For instance, the Workers’ Welfare Standards provides restrictions on worker abuse and was meant to protect the workers under abuse, nevertheless examples of exploitation remained prevalent. Targeting the sponsorship system, the country ended the exit permit requirement in 2018 and allowed the workers to have the freedom to leave. Overall, many advancements have been made to improve the workers’ access to justice, health and safety, and wages, but in order to maintain a positive trend, there needs to be increased monitoring and detection of abuse. It is necessary for companies to respect the human rights of all workers equally for the abuse of migrant workers to one day come to an end.

    "body": "2023/02/27 - Stadium 974 is one of the most unique stadiums ever built, and it is important to consider its impact on sustainability when looking at the broader construction of stadiums in general. As one of the stadiums for the FIFA World Cup, Stadium 974 witnessed Korea’s loss to Brazil and elimination, Serbia failing to advance after losing 2-3 to Switzerland, and Poland narrowly making the round of 16 after a losing to the t eventual champion Argentina. As these moments are dramatic and historic in their own way, Stadium 974 is equally historic in its advancement of sustainable stadiums. Stadium 974 is the first “dismountable” stadium ever built for the World Cup, and it is special for the notable use of 974 shipping containers in its construction, with their interior space being used for important functions such as bathrooms. The 974 is unique because it is the number reflecting the international dialing code of Qatar, which symbolizes a sense of welcome to other nations. It hosted seven games in the FIFA World Cup, consisting of six group stages games, and one game in the round of 16, showing its significance in the event. Stadium 974 is a part of Qatar’s plan to host a carbon neutral world cup, though various analyses express skepticism toward that claim. Still, Stadium 974 attempts to achieve that claim through designing and building a modular stadium that can be dismounted per-order and shipped to other locations and countries to be reassembled into a functional sports venue. This feature of reassembling addresses a specific issue that comes with constructing stadiums for major sporting events, which is when venues fall into disuse after the initial event. Such a building is also referred to as a “white elephant,” and it brings many associated environmental problems In the past, the issue of disused stadiums has occurred in many countries. For example, the Olympic Aquatics Stadium in Rio De Janeiro has had very little activity after Brazil hosted the Olympic games in 2016. The Obi Stadium in South Africa that hosted FIFA World Cup matches fell into disrepair after 2010, and the Baseball stadium in Athen met a similar end after the 2004 Summer Olympics as well. These examples highlight the issue with hosting major sporting events and there are not many instances where such big stadiums are required. Therefore, when the sporting events end, people rarely use them. Furthermore, governments also willfully stop funding stadium maintenance in some cases because of the high cost, leaving the stadiums to deteriorate. This results in an environmental issue because the construction of stadiums also emits a lot of greenhouse gasses that worsen climate change. The Carbon Market Watch estimates that Qatar emitted 1. 6 Megatonnes CO2 equivalent, illustrating the magnitude of the problem. Fortunately, stadium 974 theoretically solves this problem because the Qatari government can disassemble it when there are no sporting events that require this addition to the seven other stadiums. It can also be shipped to another country where an additional stadium might be needed, maximizing its convenience. This prevents the stadium from falling into disuse and stretches the utility of the carbon emission invested into the building of this stadium. However, Qatar did not provide clear plans for the future of Stadium 974, so the true potential of Stadium 974 remains ambiguous. Further, the impact of carbon emission of Stadium 974 is not only affected by its modular design and ability to be transported, but also the distance that it is shipped. Overall, although Stadium 974’s current future is ambiguous, it brings the issue of carbon emission associated with stadium construction into consideration, while also setting an example of a potential solution.

    "body": "2023/02/26 - During the Industrial Revolution, America transformed from an agricultural country to an industrialized one. With the emergence of large industrialists such as John D. Rockefeller with his Standard Oil company and Andrew Carnegie controlling the entire Steel industry, politicians and industrialists often neglected workers’ working conditions. Their tactic of promoting the overall economic growth has simultaneously caused serious problems such as a bigger gap of wealth and the inhumane treatment to the workers. Therefore, in response to all these intolerable regulations, workers stood up for themselves and together formed workers cooperative and labor unions. On an ordinary day of 1894 in a factory in Chicago, a worker’s strike broke out in George Pullman’s railroad cars manufacturing factory. The potential causes behind the strike serve as a reminder to the public of the worsening working conditions for the lower class workers. Different from what he has always been advertising about, Pullman treated his workers badly with very minimum wage and bad working conditions (“Pullman Strike”). To make things worse, Pullman decided to cut the wage again to further exploit his employees. In reaction to this impersonal treatment, the workers in the American Railway Union (ARU) fought back. The leader of this strike was Eugene V. Debs, who was the president of ARU. He condemned Pullman’s action, and compares him to the slave owners (“The Strike of”). Debs believed that all workers should cooperate together to fight against big industrialists and for their own working conditions. Deb served six months in jail after the strike; however, this movement has brought this critical social issue to the publics’ attention. All of this led to the establishment of the Railway Labor Act of 1926 and the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, which guaranteed the workers right to join a labor union. While other people ignored workers, Debs has always been fighting against the inhumane treatment in the industries, serving as an important reformer in the workers history. While Debs was imprisoned, Mary Harris Jones stood out for him and supported Pullman’s strike. Mother Jones was an Irish immigrant; after her husband and children died, she joined and supported the workers strike. She has helped African American workers to obtain their rights, held opposition to child labor, and also proposed a shorter working time. Most prominently, she has devoted to fight for the abolition of child labor. In the year of 1903, she joined a march with mill workers and child laborers from New York City to President Theodore Roosevelt’s Long Island home to advocate for their economic justice (“Mother Jones”). She once said that “today the white child is sold for two dollars a week to the manufacturer” in order to satirize the purposes of the industries for using those extremely cheap child labor. Her fierce reforms led to new child labor laws, which prevented children under 14 from working. These laws are still in place to this day to protect children from physical damage at a young age as well as their educational opportunities.

    "title": "America’s Immigrant Farm Workers",
    "body": "2023/02/25 - From the beginning Immigrants built America and continues to power it, making up more than a third of workers in some industries. They continue to improve our economy, creating companies around two times faster than American-born citizens. According to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, immigrants added approximately $2 trillion to the United States’ GDP in 2016 while contributing around $458. 7 billion to taxes in 2018. The National Immigration Forum reported that “employment-based immigrants are critical to the U. S. economy as they meet the temporary and permanent needs of U. S. employers in diverse industries”. The importance of immigrant workers is shown especially in terms of food production on our farms. However, despite their importance to our economy, these immigrant farm workers struggle to make ends meet as they face danger and are treated without concern for their wellbeing both on and off of the fields. According to the USDA’s Economic Research Service, about 73% of our current agriculture workers are immigrants, driving $1. 053 trillion in the farm industry and placing food on our tables for families. America’s farms are mainly located in California, Iowa, Texas, Minnesota, and Nebraska. This means that the produce that is grown in these five states are the majority of the food that ends up on America’s tables and the immigrants working on those fields keep the industry going and America fed. They face dangers everyday while working with the heavy machinery and pesticides that are used throughout the seasons. For example, in drier states such as California, wildfires are almost a constant danger and add risk for these immigrant workers on our fields. The smoke and heat of these uncontrollable flames damage the crops, and inhaling smoke and chemicals can lead to negative impacts on the workers’ physical and mental health. In 2017, wildfires in Napa and Sonoma destroyed around 500 acres of wine grapes and caused about $75 million of economic damage. Overall, immigrant workers on farms feed our families and everyday, they face danger from potential natural disasters. On top of this, the employers of these immigrant workers often take advantage of their contracts and undermine their basic human rights. The workers struggle to feed their families, find proper housing, receive low wages, are excluded from basic workers’ rights protection laws, are unable to receive proper education, and face physical, psychological, and sexual abuse out on the fields. An immigrant worker named Patricia M. reports that one of the foremen at the farm she worked on repeatedly raped her until she became pregnant and was able to file for a lawsuit. Even after these acts of assault ended, it left her traumatized and “the rape continues to affect her”. Many of the workers are undocumented or on a guest visa, such as the H-2A visa, that allows employers to hire people from out of the country, forcing workers to live with the threat of being potentially deported constantly hanging over their heads. Also, on top of that, the wages that are provided are extremely low. A family of immigrant farm workers usually earn around $25,000 at most, even including other sources of income. This limits them in their housing options, forcing them to live in unsanitary and unsafe conditions without basic utilities and in extremely isolated areas. Furthermore, the average immigrant farmworker only receives up to an 8th grade education, and children as young as twelve years old work in the fields for around thirty hours a week. In some of the worst cases, these people who are living in extreme poverty are vulnerable to human trafficking and can be coerced into paying a ridiculously high price in exchange for being helped to cross the border. With this debt, these people are now forced to work and with the high prices of food and housing and the low wages, the cycle never ends. Immigrant farmworkers are an essential part of the United States’ economy, making it all the more necessary that employers help them meet their necessary and basic needs. However, they often are not and even access to seemingly simple things like bathrooms and basic sanitation are hard to access. With the added precautions from COVID-19, conditions for immigrant workers continue to be devastating and add to the struggles that they face.

    "title": "Gender Inequality in Industries",
    "body": "2023/02/24 - Gender equality in the workplace has been a concern since the 19th century. Since then, the number of working women has risen astronomical amounts. However, this change is not exclusively positive; with the idea of a male “sole provider” becoming more and more obsolete, the male presence in the workplace has diminished significantly. Since 2010, the number of women on payroll has surpassed that of men (Wall Street Journal). Through the number of men working in industries and, more specifically, education, the declining presence of men in the workplace is visible. Prior to the 19th century, men were the only people in the workplace, yet this imbalance has drastically changed. While women have been pushing for equal rights and joining the workforce, the number of men considered to be in prime working age from 25-45 have been declining since the 60s (NPR). With the number of women on payroll being higher than that of men since 2010, there has been a lack of motivation to keep working for male workers. HEAL (health, education, administration, and literacy) had once been a male dominated area; now, the opposite now rests true. Due to this, there have been feeble attempts at encouraging men to keep working. However, not much has been done as men nowadays earn less than most men in 1979 (with inflation taken into account). Additionally, most men that are not working – whether teenagers or those in the prime working age – are not aware of this issue (NPR). These issues could stem from the education system, but not for the reasons one might think. Education has had a major impact on the number of men in the workplace. Decades ago, teaching had been a male dominated profession; now only 1 in 10 high school teachers are male, partly due to the fact that it’s seen as a low reward profession (The Atlantic). This decline dates back to the 20th century, when in 1980, 40% of teachers were male; since then, the number has only gone down. Not seeing any men in the workplace while growing up contributes to the lack of motivation for males joining the workforce as well. Without anyone to relate to or consult, many men find it difficult to visualize their future in the workplace (NPR), especially when high schools rarely take the time and effort to display working men. The number of men in the workforce has visibly declined tremendously in the past few decades due to the lack of motivation and education. Books like Richard Reeves’s Of Boys and Men have tried to tackle and bring awareness to this issue, however little has been done to resolve it. Men are struggling to find their place in the workplace, and the numbers of employed men in the prime working age needs to rise; if not, as the numbers keep going down, the presence of male workers will be non-existent.

    "title": "Amazon's Worker's Rights (or lack of them)",
    "body": "2023/02/23 - For years, Amazon has been at the forefront of controversy about the treatment of its workers. Though the company denies its infractions of workers rights, critics have exposed how detrimental these working conditions are. Studies by the Strategic Organizing Center note that Amazon’s “obsession with speed” puts the workers in danger. When workers fall under the pressure of meeting stringent production quotas, their risk of injury increases. Nearly one in five of Amazon’s delivery drivers suffered injuries in 2021. This injury rate alarmingly increased by 40% from last year’s. This obsession with speed is also apparent in the way that they strictly monitor their employees. Workers are constantly criticized for “idle time”, even if it lasts for just a few minutes. An Amazon spokesman has revealed: “Performance is only measured when an employee is at their station and logged in to do their job. ” However, Darren Westwood, an Amazon worker, highly condemns these policies. He has revealed his distress about how even his bathroom breaks are tracked and the way that managers constantly question him about his idle time. Amazon had aspired to control its workers even further by patenting a design for a wristband that tracks the workers’ locations and “nudging” them in the direction of their next assignment, creating a tight schedule and toxic work environment. Due to ethical issues, Amazon abandoned this patent, but the spirit of this bizarre concept lives on. Recently, on December 27 2022, 61-year-old Rick Jacobs died at the Amazon DEN4 warehouse in Colorado Springs, Colorado, yet instead of moving the body, managers created a makeshift barrier around the deceased worker using cardboard bins, outrageously claiming that this act would avoid distracting other employees from work. Witnesses were shocked by the “blatant disregard of human emotions at this facility”. An anonymous worker discloses: “No one should have been told to work alongside a dead body, particularly after witnessing it…[we received] no warnings before walking into the building”. Another asks: “Do you think we could not have had a little respect and shut down long enough to at least get the body out of the facility and clean up after him before people are milling around like nothing’s happening?” Amazon’s disregard for the well-being of its workers also applies economically. On January 25, 2023, Amazon warehouse workers in rhe UK staged their first-ever strike over pay and working conditions. Staff were angered with the pay increase of just 50 pence per hour. Workers claim that the 5% pay increase fails to match the inflation of living costs and want a minimum £15 an hour. Some of the staff are working up to 60 hours a week just so they can meet mortgage payments. Westwood revealed to CNBC: “Someone the other day said we’re treated like robots—no, robots are treated better”. Bogdan, another participant in the strike, said that this extremely low pay offer insulted staff. He chose to join the strike because he wanted the public to “understand what is going on” behind the scenes every time they choose the convenience of Amazon. Though Amazon attempts to cover up these situations and portray themselves as a perfect corporation, one must accept that these events are a reality that threaten workers rights to safety and economic stability.

    "title": "South African Erosion of Workers’ Rights",
    "body": "2023/02/22 - The single-room tin homes of South Africa’s 500+ townships are testaments to the radical inequality that remains as a legacy of Apartheid, South Africa’s past oppressive system of government which enforced racial segregation. Almost 30 years post-Apartheid, South African wealth distribution is still vastly unequal. The various attempts to redistribute wealth have created a slightly more diverse yet still highly exclusive upper economic echelon which excludes the vast majority of the population. Adding on to the concerning economic and social status of South Africa, jobs are scarce with the unemployment rate at around 43% and people are desperate. Consequently, any work is coveted by those trapped in poverty, and competition for job slots is immense. This desperation facilitates the exploitation of economically disadvantaged South Africans, and the rendering of labour laws null and void. There are three major reasons for this: the desperation of the workers, the wage of labour, and the weak South African government. Firstly, in South Africa, there are a number of labour laws meant to implement a meaningful minimum wage and protect menial labour workers. However, a vast number of labourers are desperate enough to work for anything and as a result, the sanctity of labour laws is largely non-existent. Many workers will accept short-term work which brings in cash quickly, but are not sustainable jobs. As such, employers don’t feel the same level of responsibility for the wellbeing of their employees, and often get away with underpaying and overworking individuals. Secondly, there is an issue surrounding the culture of menial labour in South Africa - there is a running joke among immigrants from first world countries that labour is “free”, because the comparative price of having three full time domestic workers barely begins to reach the cost of hiring an au-pair to watch your children for a week in the US. Consequently, almost all South African middle and upper class households will employ at least one full time worker to do tasks from cleaning the house to raising the children. These low standards of payment for domestic workers and with a set minimum wage of R23. 19 (less than $1. 40), has made it very difficult to reshape salaries for South African manual labourers. As a result, escaping poverty is highly unlikely and extremely hard for workers, even with a full-time job. Finally, the South African government has largely failed in the implementation of labour laws. The South African justice system fails frequently, making it one of the crime capitals of the world. Additionally, government efficiency is significantly hindered by endemic corruption, which fuels policy decisions that are often more advantageous for government officials than they are for citizens. Consequently, mistreatment of employees and strong-arming employees into silence to disincentivize legal action and accountability has become the norm, and the mechanisms in place designed to deal with this are often inaccessible or ineffective. Worker rights in South Africa, while somewhat enshrined in law, have been forgotten or abused in practice, an issue which has existed for much of South Africa’s dark history and remains as a part of the legacy of a deeply divided state. The path forward for South Africa is a long one, and will require a shift in the way the country views labour and values upliftment of disadvantaged communities.

    "title": "Minimum Wage Sick Days and the Problems With Worker's Rights",
    "body": "2023/02/22 - Though we view the United States as a whole, labor laws vary from state to state, and many simply chalk these variances up to differences in political parties. Yet, labor laws in blue-dominated states do not necessarily trump those of the red ones. The upshot: no matter the political party, most states fall well short of offering workers the rights they need. Take minimum wage for example. In New York, a traditionally blue state, workers must make a minimum of $14. 20 per hour, while in Texas, a traditionally red state, the minimum wage is $7. 25 an hour. The latter seems particularly low. Minimum wage workers in Texas make an average of $58 a day, with their salary totaling around $15,080 per year – well below MIT’s designated livable wage of $34,132. 80 for a single adult without children in Texas. However, the situation in New York isn’t much better. A minimum wage worker there would make $29,536 a year, which is still far below the livable wage of $44,636. 80. When taking into account living expenses, New York and Texas are not so different after all – both fail to provide the minimum to support their residents’ livelihoods. Wages are not the only problem at hand for workers. Sick days are also an essential part of having a stable job, as anyone who caught Covid during the past three years knows well. In Texas, workers are not legally entitled to sick days and are not compensated for them. Surprisingly, this fact is true for workers in New York state as well and seems particularly problematic, considering the low wages and high living expenses that residents of the state face. The absence of paid leave forces workers to choose between staying home while sick or making enough money to get by – options that are impossible to pick between. Obviously, problems with workers’ rights are found in both Democratic and Republican states and go much deeper than political affiliation. The common misconception of labor laws is that they are regulated better in blue states than in red states, but a simple comparison of New York and Texas quickly debunks this idea. The reason for this is that, most often, the cost of living is not taken into consideration when looking at a minimum wage. Even though we view New York as a very liberal state, the disparities between income and spending show that the state must do better to ensure that workers are treated fairly. Of course, that goes for Texas too.  Sources: Living Wage Calculator - Living Wage Calculation for Texas. https://livingwage. mit. edu/states/48.

    "title": "Inequalities in the AI industry",
    "body": "2023/02/22 - The AI industry, like many technology sectors, has faced criticism for a lack of diversity and unequal treatment of certain groups. This can manifest in a variety of ways, such as diversity and inclusion, bias in AI systems, and job automation. The AI industry has a significant lack of diversity, especially in leadership positions and technical roles. This leads to a homogeneous culture and limited perspectives in the development and deployment of AI systems. Research has shown that the AI workforce is predominantly male and from certain ethnic and cultural backgrounds, which can lead to bias in the development and deployment of AI systems. To address this problem, many companies and organizations are taking steps to increase diversity and inclusivity in the AI industry, such as through initiatives aimed at recruiting and retaining underrepresented groups and promoting equal opportunities in the workplace. The increasing use of AI and automation technologies in various industries has led to job automation, where tasks previously performed by humans are now being carried out by machines or algorithms. While this has brought many benefits, such as increased efficiency and lower costs, it has also had an impact on employment, as some jobs are becoming obsolete. However, it is important to note that AI and automation are also creating new jobs in fields such as data science, machine learning, and software development. Additionally, some experts believe that AI could potentially enhance existing jobs by allowing workers to focus on more creative and higher-value tasks. Nevertheless, the impact of AI and automation on employment is a complex issue that requires ongoing attention and investment in workforce development and training programs. Bias in AI systems refers to the phenomenon where an algorithm or model shows unfair or discriminatory behavior towards certain groups of people based on factors such as race, gender, age, or socioeconomic status. This can occur due to a number of reasons, such as the use of biased data in training models, the choice of algorithms or features that reinforce existing biases, or the lack of diversity among the individuals developing and deploying the AI systems. Bias in AI systems can have serious consequences, including discrimination in areas such as hiring, lending, and criminal justice. To address this problem, it is important to have diverse teams working on AI development and deployment, to use unbiased training data, and to regularly evaluate and test AI systems for bias. There is also a growing body of research in the field of fair AI, which aims to develop methods for creating AI systems that are equitable and unbiased. When there is a divide between those who have access to AI technologies and those who do not, the widening of the digital divide and unequal distribution of the benefits of AI will surely. Unequal access to AI technologies refers to the unequal distribution of resources and opportunities for individuals and organizations to use and benefit from AI. This can be due to factors such as geographic location, financial resources, technical expertise, and access to data, leading to disparities in the development and deployment of AI solutions. The lack of equal access to AI technologies can result in a widening of the digital divide and exacerbate existing socio-economic inequalities. Addressing this challenge requires collaboration and investment from governments, private organizations, and the wider AI community. Addressing these inequalities in the AI industry requires a concerted effort from all stakeholders, including companies, governments, and communities, to promote diversity and inclusion, provide reskilling and job opportunities, reduce bias in AI systems, and ensure equitable access to AI technologies.

    "body": "2022/11/30 - Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian woman, died in custody on September 16, 2022. Iranian authorities arrested and transported her to a detention center because she did not completely cover her hair with her hijab, which violated Iran’s strict Islamic clothing regulations. Three days after her detainment, she died inside a hospital. Police claim that this sudden death was due to underlying health problems and a heart attack, but according to Amini’s parents, their daughter was in perfect health before the incident. Witnesses claim that they saw authorities beating her as they took her away, which aroused widespread controversy and protests In response to Mahsa Amini’s death, Iranian residents who believe that Amini’s death was not an accident flooded the streets in protest. This sudden resistance of the people is extremely monumental and rare for modern-day Iran. Iran ranks #178 out of 180 countries on the World Press Freedom Index, suggesting a reserved culture with strong religious regulations. However, Iranian women began to break free from the past traditions by marching in protest and burning their hijabs in public in response to the death of Mahsa Amini. The popular chant, “Women, Life, Freedom,” is often used in both the streets of Iran and online in an attempt to shed light on the situation in Iran. In addition to in person protests, the Iranians used the internet as an outlet to further their ideas and convey their stance on the issue despite government censorship. Through the internet, non-Iranians have also discovered Amini’s story and started to post pictures of themselves cutting their hair in solidarity. As a result of the efforts, the issue spread overseas and protests emerged abroad in places such as Istanbul, Madrid, and New York. Amini’s death has broken the hearts of many people from different backgrounds, as it portrayed another example of a government making decisions that many considers as against moral principals. However, it has also opened people’s eyes to some of the horrors that occur when the government interweaves religion with everyday life. This event caused a roaring call for change in society from many, and these women will continue to voice their opposition to the government until Iran transforms for the better. We can only hope that this thorn of lasting pain changes into a blossoming new flower of the future for Iran. Written by Aava Ghorbanian "

    "title": "Women's Rights: Movements",
    "body": "2022/11/29 - Throughout history, there have been similar protests for women’s rights to the ones happening in Iran. While there are so many, the mentioned below are some of the more well known movements: Suffrage MovementIn 1848, The Seneca Falls Convention in Seneca Falls, New York, led by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott, sparked the beginning of the Suffrage Movement. Over 300 people, mostly women, attended the convention. They created the Document of Sentiments and Grievances, modeling it after the Declaration of Independence, asserting gender equality between men and women. With the belief that women deserve political power just like men, the suffragists became more active in the 1900s through mass protests and picketing. As the United States entered World War I, women began to take jobs that men left behind, leading President Woodrow Wilson to understand the importance of women in modern day society. Decades after the 14th and 15th amendments granted male’s suffrage rights, President Wilson proposed the 19th amendment that enfranchised suffrage rights to women, which was finally passed in 1920 and brought an end to the suffrage movement and gave women the rights they had been fighting for. Women’s Liberation Movement: Bra Burning at the Miss America PageantThe Women’s Liberation Movement was a far reaching and international fight for women’s rights, held from the 1960s-1980s. Specifically, in the United States, liberationists protested against the Miss America Pageant for the objectification of women’s bodies, which viewed women as mere objects to men’s sexual desires instead of people. The liberationists protested at a pageant being held in New Jersey, throwing their bras, lipsticks, high heels, and more, into a trash can, labeled the “Freedom Trash Can”. While the event was known for the burning of the can, the fire was reported to be accidental and put out quickly. However, the extinguishing of the fire does not extinguish the efforts and spirit of the women who showed up and fought for their rights. Take Back the NightTake Back the Night is an organization that had its first event in England in 1877, where women protested for the violence and fear they felt as they walked at night. As this movement gained popularity, it spread to the United States. For example, in 1972, women marched through the University of Southern Florida campus, demanding more resources for their education. In 1978, Take Back the Night marched once again in San Francisco to protest against the snuff pornography being distributed and the women being murdered for it. Then, again in 1975, Susan Alexander Speeth was murdered while walking back home, sparking another march against the unsafety women experience at night. At the International Tribunal on Crimes Against Women convention in Belgium, women marched with candles to fight for the ability to walk the streets at night safely and without fear. All those events aimed to earn security for women, and in the 21st century, Take Back the Night still continues to empower women and protect them against sexual injustice. Women2Drive MovementIn Saudi Arabia, the government placed a ban to prevent women from driving in 1957, becoming the only country that denies women the right to drive motor vehicles. Reacting to this injustice, people fought to revoke this ban, initiating the Women2Drive movement in November 1990, where 47 women drove through Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. They were arrested and had their passports taken away from them, but their drive was enough to spark a new movement. Then, on October 26, 2013, despite being warned of arrest, groups of women took to the streets once again; this time, without arrests. In November 2014, Lujain al-Hathoul also attempted to drive into Saudi Arabia from the United Arab Emirates, but she was arrested for 70 days, along with al-Sharif, who had come to help her. Finally, as the movement became more and more publicized, the ban was finally lifted in June 2018, giving the women of Saudi Arabia the right to drive. March for Women’s RightsIn 2003, the Partial-Birth Abortion Act was passed, banning intact dilation and extraction, which was a surgical procedure that removes a fetus from a uterus. This procedure was used in the situation of a miscarriage or an abortion in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. With the new act banning this procedure, it limited women’s freedom and their access to safe healthcare, endangering their lives. As a show of unity and spirit against this act, around 1. 3 million people showed up to the March for Women’s Rights event on April 25, 2004. It was held in Washington, D. C. on the National Mall. This protest was organized by several associations like Planned Parenthood, NOW, Black Women’s Health Imperative, Feminist Majority, NARAL, National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health, and ACLU. While they were unable to achieve their goal of rescinding the act, it showed the determination of the pro-choice movement.

    "title": "Religious and Government Separation",
    "body": "2022/11/29 - A hijab is a head covering worn by Muslim women, mandated by law in majority of the Middle Eastern countries, like Iran and Afghanistan. The recent death of Mahsa Amini in Morality Police custody brought religious laws like these into question. It also sparks controversy, as it forces us to reconcile the role religions should play in nations. All in all, religion and state should separate, because people can control governments, but not religion. Government is fluid while religion is set in stone. Binding religion with government infringes on people’s political freedom, as the Guardian council in the Iranian government shows. It is composed of the top twelve members of the Shia clergy who use their power to dampen reformist influence in the Iranian government. For example, in 2004, the council barred more than 3,600 reformist-independent candidates from participating in elections. It also routinely cancels votes from reformist districts. Clearly, the guardian council, a religious voice in the Iranian government, uses its influence to increase bipartisan control in Iranian politics. And though the Guardian Council and other religious elements in the government appear to be conservative, the reality is that it is simply unadaptable. Religion can’t change, because dogma in itself is a set of rules to obey by. In this clash of religious code and political law, religion will always interfere with the government because it itself is a governance, in a sense. The consequence of this clash of interest is limited political freedom to all. This undermines equality in political participation and freedom, continuing the pattern that leads to further corruption and suppression of the citizens’ voices, as we can see through the case of Mahsa Amini. Religious governance also jeopardizes citizens’ religious freedom. In medieval Europe, for instance, the power of Catholic Christanity is ubiquitous, though many monarchs taint this power by their cruelness. King Ferdinand II of Aragon exemplifies this, establishing the Spanish Inquisition in 1478 to try heretics among the Jews and Muslims who recently converted to Christanity. In addition, King Charles IX of France instigated the St. Bartholomew’s Day Massacre after ordering the assassination of Protestant leaders in France. Moreover, fear and mob mentality influenced civil and religious courts, leading to mass prosecutions of people suspected of witchcraft, which resulted in over 60,000 deaths. In the context of medieval violence and social unrest, having a state affiliated with religion defeats the purpose of government as agents for stability, because the government becomes biased against minority religion groups. The absolutist rulers who get power from divine ordain have numerous means to appropriate certain changes in their state. They frequently prosecute religious minorities to appeal to the religious majority, thus consolidating their power. Absolutist power magnifies the destructive effects of discriminatory laws and royal decrees while Local power bends heavily toward religious law. This jeopardizes the religious freedom of all. In contrast, a government whose power doesn’t depend on religion has nothing to justify their rule unless the subjects - citizens - agree that governance is mutually beneficial. The government must change and adapt to the citizens or face rebellion and disloyalty. An example of this is Democracy. In it, candidates for positions of power are decided by popularity, not religion, which promotes a constant state of change within the government, and prevents prolonged abuses of power. A government that does not identify with any religion is also more religiously free because without the intervention of a main state religion, people tend to choose religions that suit them the most, knowing at least they won’t be politically penalized. Religion and government are incompatible, though religion is a broad term that defines much more than the examples mentioned above. “Religion” as a noun has a specific definition, but you can be “religiously” committed to many things. In the context of government, you can expand the meaning of the word to include atheism, societal ownership of means of production (socialism), personality cults (Stalin, Mao), confucianism, and so on, goals that governments are so vested in that they act similarly to religious states in dedication and sometimes, cruelty. Religion and state must separate, but we should also be aware of the danger of religious devotion elsewhere, for, the government serves the people first, not their obsessions.

    "title": "Religion and Human Rights",
    "body": "2022/11/29 - The recent event of Mahsa Amini has left room for debate of what takes precedence nationwide: religion or human rights. Religion is a system of attitudes, beliefs, and practices (Marriam-Webster), and its priority in government affairs has been debated for thousands of years. While some believe that faith is more important than the fundamental human rights that belong to all persons (Marriam-Webster), others disagree. Countries like the United States place individual rights before religious practices, while others, like Iran, integrate faith into their laws and daily practices. The United States has been a secular country since its independence, meaning that religion is not a considered factor when passing laws or verdicts in court. An individual’s faith may not impact any decision at the legal level and may not be the cause of any discrimination. In the United States, the government remains unbiased in all of its legal and political decisions, protecting people’s rights over religion regardless of one’s belief. For example, according to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, employers may not consider religion when hiring, firing, or making any other decisions in the workplace. It also states that employers must accommodate employees’ religious beliefs and practices, which protects people’s right of freedom of religion (United States Department of Labor). Overall, the United States prioritizes human rights over religion. Contrary to the United States, religion often outweighs human rights in Iran. Since its establishment, Iran has been an Islamic country. Government officials take Islamic doctrines into account with every decision they make, incorporating religion into the laws. A 2021 Report on International Religious Freedom states that Iran has been a “Country of Particular Concern” (U. S. Department of State) since 1999 for violating the International Freedom Act of 1998, by suppressing other minority religious groups. In fact, the Iranian government does not tolerate the practice of any religion other than Islam, and strictly enforces rules set by the Quran - define Quran (U. S. Department of State). The recent death of Mahsa Amini reflects the severe consequences for those who violate Islamic law, further emphasizes the importance of Islam in the Iranian government. Women who improperly wear their hijab face serious penalties, and the government often disregards opposition to the dress code. In Iran, religion, specifically Islam, greatly overshadows human rights. The importance of religion and human rights varies from countries , with some like the United States that encourage the free practice of one’s faith and some like Iran that strictly enforce rules based on a certain religion. This debate puts in perspective the priorities of a country and leaves one wondering how far a country will go to govern its people based on that priority.

    "body": "2022/11/29 - Women’s subordination within our patriarchal society originated from the labor division during the Neolithic Era, where women assumed a domestic role, while men acted as the providers for households. As our societies developed, new forms of sexual discrimination and unequal treatments continued this subordination. For example, during the industrial revolution, women faced a limited choice of employment of mainly teachers and servants, while men took on other employment opportunities, like farmers and craftsmen. In the present day, the increasing influence of feminism has led women to fight for their rights and freedom, and their effort have only been successful through the hard work and perseverance of many brave advocates and martyrs. For the past centuries, many countries continue to oppress women’s rights. Iran, also known as the Islamic Republic, has been one of the most restrictive countries on women’s rights. In a recent report made by the World Economic Forum, rating countries on the “economic participation, educational attainment, health, and political survival of women” (Radio Free Europe Radio Liberty), Iran ranked 143 out of 146 countries. The statistics were especially poor in the categories of Economic Participation and Opportunity and Political Empowerment. In 2021, only 6% of the seats in the Iranian parliament were held by women. In 2020, only 19% of senior and middle management positions consisted of women. These sets of reported data show the limitations women face in politics and economics. However, the issue at hand is due to the oppressive social dress codes enforced by government and patriarchal policies, giving the women of Iran no room for freedom. Currently, in support of Mahsa Amini, a young woman who was recently made a martyr for women’s rights, people around the world have risen up to fight against the oppression placed on women in Iran. After being violently arrested by the morality police and beaten for breaching hijab dress codes, Amini died in the hospital. According to state news, she reportedly went into cardiac arrest, falling into a coma. However, her mother reported that Amini was only 22 and was in perfect health, making it likely that the true cause of her death was due to the torture she experienced in police custody. Following Amini’s death, protests spread quickly through the power of social media, inspiring many youths to participate in these rallies and connect to fights against the unjust towards women. Many of them show their support by defying hijab laws, like removing their hijabs, burning them, and waving their hijabs in the air with their hair uncovered. In response to these protests, the government has reacted through gun usage, surveillance, and internet restrictions, leading to many injuries and thousands of fatalities. Security forces have raided schools across the country in order to contain the protests, resulting in hundreds of people, including children, being killed, with even more injured. Additionally, among the 15,000 people detained, the average age of the protesters is 15 years old. As protests in Iran continue for more than eight weeks, people around the world show support through their own rallies and spread the topic on social media. In order to liberate the women of Iran and bring global equality, we must continue to address the protests in Iran, while showing one stance of unity against the oppression they face.

    "body": "2022/09/18 - Abortion. A widely controversial topic that has been hotly debated and discussed, especially in the past year with the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Since ancient times, abortions have been performed through a number of methods. Common practices include herbal abortifacients, sharp tools, or traditional medicine that date back to ancient China, Egypt, India, and the Roman Empire. With abortion’s extensive history in so many cultures, it is no surprise that laws were also put in place regarding this practice. At different points in time, Japan, China, India, and ancient Rome all had bans placed on abortions with varying levels of severity. But why do people ban abortions? Religious followers vehemently quote from the Old Testament, which states that life starts at conception; thus, aborting a fetus would result in murder. Some medical scholars refer to the Hippocratic Oath, stating that it prevents them from performing abortions. Even today, anti-abortionists sport a wide range of reasons that only they can justify. In this month’s issue, we address today’s most pressing issue regarding abortion: Roe v. Wade. You will get to read the two sides of this topic, as well as a timeline regarding the history of abortion, and eventually form your own educated opinion on the ethics of abortion. "

    "body": "2022/09/10 - The Reconstruction Era, a nationwide effort to rebuild and stabilize the country after the Civil War and assimilate freed slaves into society with their newly conferred rights, had officially ended in 1877, a little over a decade before. Yet, this new withdrawal of Northern troops and influence from the south led to the rise of what we know today to be the Era of Jim Crow. In 1890, the state of Louisiana passed the Separate Car Act, requiring all railroads to provide train cars that were “separate but [had] equal accommodations” which would segregate black passengers from whites. This was following a chain of similar bills in neighboring states, after Florida took the lead by passing the first law dictating that railroad cars must be segregated in 1887. In resistance to the Separate Car Act, Homer Adolph Plessy pulled a “Rosa Parks. ” Or rather, Rosa Parks was the one who pulled a “Plessy” several decades later. On June 7th, 1892, Plessy took a train, sat down on the car for whites, refused to leave, and was subsequently arrested. While being tried for violating the Separate Car Act, Plessy countered by claiming that the law was unconstitutional and it infringed on the 14th Amendment which guaranteed freed slaves citizenship, rights, and equal protection. (The judge presiding over his case was Hon. John Ferguson, hence the name, Plessy v. Ferguson. ) Four years later, after a series of court battles, the case finally made it way up to the Supreme Court, where the court ruled in a landmark case that “separate but equal” was constitutional. They argued that the Equal Protection Clause in the 14th Amendment, which mandates that states cannot discriminate against individuals based on unrelated differences, does not apply to “social rights. ” With this case, the Supreme Court constitutionalized segregation, and it marked the rise of Jim Crow laws. The case was not overturned until 1954, with the Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, which ruled that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. Plessy v. Ferguson remains today as one of the most notable cases concerning social rights in American history. One of the conservative justices, Samuel Alito, who voted in favor of Roe v. Wade’s overturning, refers to Plessy v. Ferguson as an example of an “egregiously wrong” decision and compares it to Roe v. Wade, calling them both unconstitutional “from the day it was decided. ” What he doesn’t seem to accept is that Plessy’s case legalized segregation and took away countless rights of blacks for decades, while Roe v. Wade protected women’s rights and its recent overturning in favor of fetal rights proves the opposite effect. These two landmark decisions both had lasting effects on American society and history. While Plessy forced an uphill battle for the rights of millions of black Americans in the 20th century, we can only wait to see whether or not Roe’s overturning will follow similar historical trends.

There is not much debate surrounding the morality of it, as traditional Chinese beliefs perceive the right to live as starting at birth. IndiaAbortion is legal for rape victims and in case of severe fetal anomaly, but it requires a long process of approval, resulting in it being inaccessible to many people. U. S. The legality of abortion depends on the states. As of now, many states are split between protecting abortion and making it illegal. IndonesiaAbortion is legal in medical emergencies, as well as in cases of severe fetal anomaly. It’s also legal for cases of rape before six weeks of gestation have passed. The process is severely complicated and ambiguous, and many people are unable to obtain an abortion. For every 100,000 live births, there are 305 maternal deaths. PakistanPolicies are generally against abortion, except in ambiguous cases of “good faith” or “necessary treatment”. Many women attempt to get unsafe abortions, which majorly contributes to avoidable injuries and death. In 2002, 197,000 women were estimated to have been hospitalized for unsafe abortion complications. NigeriaAbortion laws in Nigeria have not changed since 1861. They remain illegal, unless done to save the life of a pregnant woman. Around 50. 6 per 1,000 women of reproductive age attempt to get an abortion, making it one of the highest rates in the world. BrazilMany women attempt to buy Misoprostol on the black market in order to get an illegal abortion. Abortion is legal only to save a woman’s life, or if the pregnancy was a result of rape or incest. Unsafe abortions are the fourth leading cause of maternal deaths in the country. BangladeshAbortion is only legal to save a woman’s life. However, Menstrual Regulation, which is used to bring back regular menstruation, is available.

    "title": " Roe v. Wade: How was the Decision Made?",
    "body": "2022/09/02 - Roe v. Wade was a legal decision made by the supreme court in 1973, striking down the Texas statute of criminalizing abortion. The decision made the statement that a woman’s right to abortion is part of the privacy that is protected in the 14th amendment. Before Roe v. Wade, states placed heavy restrictions on abortions, many of them illegalizing them. In 1970, Norma McCorvey, a. k. a Jane Roe (to preserve privacy), took federal action against Henry Rade, who was the district attorney of Dallas county in Texas. The question was “Does the Constitution recognize a woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy by abortion?” Roe asserted that she had an absolute right to terminate her pregnancy at any time, but the Supreme Court disagreed, trying to balance a woman’s right of privacy as well as trying to regulate abortion. Finally, the Supreme Court decided to place a point in the pregnancy; after a certain amount of time, no more abortion would be allowed. They set this point at around 24 weeks of pregnancy, meaning that before 24 weeks, women were allowed to have abortions legally. There have been repeated challenges against Roe v. Wade from 1973 to before 2022, but none succeeded in overturning it, but managed to narrow the scope further. On Friday, June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, removing 50 years of legal protection for abortion rights. This left abortion laws and restrictions to the states. Because of laws that were put into place before the ruling, abortion is now outlawed in many states. As of now, Idaho, Texas, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, and West Virginia have banned abortion. Georgia has stated that any abortions after 6 weeks of pregnancy are illegal, while Utah, North Carolina, and Florida have stated that abortions after 20 weeks are illegal. In California, Washington, Oregon, Alaska, New Mexico, Minnesota, Illinois, New York, Vermont, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Maine, abortions are completely legal. In Nevada, Colorado, Nebraska, Kansas, Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island, abortions are legal but limited. For Arizona, Utah, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, and South Carolina, bans are being considered but are not in place yet. "

            <!-- Article -->

			<p>Gender equality in the workplace has been a concern since the 19th century. Since then, the number of working women has risen astronomical amounts. However, this change is not exclusively positive; with the idea of a male “sole provider” becoming more and more obsolete, the male presence in the workplace has diminished significantly. Since 2010, the number of women on payroll has surpassed that of men (Wall Street Journal). Through the number of men working in industries and, more specifically, education, the declining presence of men in the workplace is visible.</p>

<p>Prior to the 19th century, men were the only people in the workplace, yet this imbalance has drastically changed. While women have been pushing for equal rights and joining the workforce, the number of men considered to be in prime working age from 25-45 have been declining since the 60s (NPR). With the number of women on payroll being higher than that of men since 2010, there has been a lack of motivation to keep working for male workers. HEAL (health, education, administration, and literacy) had once been a male dominated area; now, the opposite now rests true. Due to this, there have been feeble attempts at encouraging men to keep working. However, not much has been done as men nowadays earn less than most men in 1979 (with inflation taken into account). Additionally, most men that are not working – whether teenagers or those in the prime working age – are not aware of this issue (NPR). These issues could stem from the education system, but not for the reasons one might think.</p>

<p>Education has had a major impact on the number of men in the workplace. Decades ago, teaching had been a male dominated profession; now only 1 in 10 high school teachers are male, partly due to the fact that it’s seen as a low reward profession (The Atlantic). This decline dates back to the 20th century, when in 1980, 40% of teachers were male; since then, the number has only gone down. Not seeing any men in the workplace while growing up contributes to the lack of motivation for males joining the workforce as well. Without anyone to relate to or consult, many men find it difficult to visualize their future in the workplace (NPR), especially when high schools rarely take the time and effort to display working men.
The number of men in the workforce has visibly declined tremendously in the past few decades due to the lack of motivation and education. Books like Richard Reeves’s Of Boys and Men have tried to tackle and bring awareness to this issue, however little has been done to resolve it. Men are struggling to find their place in the workplace, and the numbers of employed men in the prime working age needs to rise; if not, as the numbers keep going down, the presence of male workers will be non-existent.</p>
